            <h1 style=" text-align: center">Turtles You Can in Sri Lanka</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sri Lanka's biodiversity includes turtles, and the nation is renowned for its abundant turtle population and conservation efforts. Five different species of sea turtles may be found in Sri Lanka, and they are divided into groups based on how they nest and how they look. These species are all either endangered or vulnerable due to human activities such as overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. Therefore it is crucial to protect these species to maintain a healthy marine ecosystem.

                This huge sea turtle has an olive or brown heart-shaped shell and was given its name after the color of its fat,
                which was once used to make turtle soup. Adult males are smaller than females, and they don't have the hook-shaped
                jaws like other turtles do. Green turtles are widespread in tropical areas and are frequently seen near oceanic
                islands with broad sand beaches. Every nest contains between 100 and 170 eggs, and nesting takes place all year
                round. After an incubation period of roughly two months, the hatchlings emerge.

                The Loggerhead turtle is a reddish brown turtle with a huge head that grows to 1.2 meters in length. They also inhabit
                lagoons, bays, and estuaries and eat crustaceans and mollusks (their strong jaws have evolved to crush the shells of
                these animals). These marine turtles, which are the rarest in Sri Lanka, are reported to lay their eggs on the country's
                southern and southern-eastern beaches between September and March. In a single clutch, they can lay up to 175 eggs, and
                the hatchlings appear two months later.

            The Hawksbill turtle measures around 1 m in length and has an olive-green shell. The short, protruding, forward-facing
            jaw that resembles a bird's beak gives this creature its name. They are typically considered to just eat sea sponges,
            yet it has been shown that they also eat algae, coral, and shellfish. They are frequently found in reefs, bays,
            estuaries, and lagoons. These turtles land to lay clutches of up to 175 eggs, which hatch in around 2 months.
            Fortunately for them, the Hawksbill's flesh has been proven to be deadly, and eating its meat has been linked to
            multiple fatalities. They are now in danger, though, as a result of what has happened.
